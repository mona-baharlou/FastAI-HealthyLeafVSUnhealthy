# FastAI-HealthyLeafVSUnhealthy
This repository contains an image classification model built to identify whether a plant leaf is healthy or diseased. Using the powerful fastai deep learning library, this project demonstrates a practical application of computer vision, from gathering and preparing data to training a robust model capable of assisting with plant health diagnosis.
